March 25, 2025: from here forward, it is requested that all Commits to this repository adhere to the 
Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification, as outlined at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ and summarized below:

  with the commit message structured as follows:

  <type>[optional scope]: <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer(s)]

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

	1. build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g., updating scope(s): gulp, broccoli, npm)
	2. fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
	3. feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
	4. docs: Documentation-only changes (e.g., updating README file(s)).
	5. style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., formatting, white-space, missing semi-colons, etc).
	6. refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (e.g., restructuring code for better readability).
	7. perf: A code change that improves performance.
	8. test: Adding, or updating/correcting existing, tests (e.g., unit tests or integration).
	9. BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a 
	   breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
	10. other types: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)
		recommends chore:, ci:, and others.
	11. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
