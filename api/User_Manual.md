# ITSC-3155 Section-051 Group-7 Final Project User Manual

## 1. Introduction - Project Overview

This project designs, plans, and builds an Online Restaurant Ordering System (OROS), built using FastAPI, MySQL, 
and SQLAlchemy.  The solution provides a RESTful API for managing orders, customers, menu items, and more. The 
project uses SwaggerUI for API/database interaction and CRUD operation validation, eliminating the need for a 
frontend.  We use GitHub for version control and collaborative development.
The solution is near barebones, but it is a working solution satisfying requirements of the course project and 
built using Agile-Scrum framework - building a Product Back Log with (prioritized) User Stories, a Use Case 
Diagram, a Class Diagram, and an Activity Diagram (with Swim Lanes) to aid in overall design and work planning
leading to the final building of the coded solution.  The project is designed to be easy to use and understand,
with clear documentation and examples provided. 
The primary objective of the project being to design, analyze, and build a working solution for an Online 
Restaurant Ordering System (OROS) that demonstrates understanding of setup and use of a RESTful API, and execution
of database CRUD operations.

No frontend build was required, instead, opting to demonstrate/conduct API-interactive CRUD operations, we use [Uvicorn](https://uvicorn.org) - an ASGI web server
implementation for Python - in conjunction with [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

### 1.1. Prerequisites

With MySQL Server running and the SwaggerUI instantiated, your browser should have a multi-page long menu that looks like this:

If not, refer to the Technical Document for troubleshooting steps which walks you thru the process of setting up the project,
to get the SwaggerUI to work.  The Technical Document also provides a detailed overview of the project, including the technology stack used,
the database schema, and the API endpoints.

, and Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your (local) system:
